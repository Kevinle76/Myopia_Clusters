# Myopia_Clusters
## Background:

A medical research company thatâ€™s interested in finding better ways to predict myopia, or nearsightedness, exploring this possibility by using unsupervised learning. 

Fitting data to a model and using clustering algorithms to place data into groups. Then, creating a visualization that shares findings. 

## Objectives:

* Part 1: Prepare the Data

* Part 2: Apply Dimensionality Reduction

* Part 3: Perform a Cluster Analysis with K-means

* Part 4: Make recommendation"

4.1 Myopia Clusters Findings:

The optimal number of clusters seems to be 3

t-SNE was not helpful in finding clusters, there was some some difference after adjusting perplexity but this could be due to random noise.

Some patterns after performing the K-Means clustering but the dataset is small to make an accurate prediction or for further splitting and training of data.

4.2 Recommendation: using a bigger dataset and spliting the data into Test and Training to test the above models and others to be able to make more accurate predictions and clustering.
